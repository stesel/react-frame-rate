# Contributing to react-frame-rate

## Contributing

👍🎉 Thanks for contributing! 🎉👍

We expect contributors follow [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
All conversations and discussions on GitHub (issues, pull requests) must be respectful and harassment-free.

## Where to contribute

All [issues](https://github.com/stesel/react-frame-rate/issues) are ready for grabs.

In case of doubt, ask a [owner of this repository](https://github.com/stesel) by mentioning on the issue.

**Refactoring** code, e.g., improving the code without modifying the behavior is an area that can probably be done based on intuition and may not require much communication to be merged.

**Fixing bugs** may also not require a lot of communication, but the more, the better. Please surround bug fixes with ample tests. Bugs are magnets for other bugs. Write tests near bugs!

**Building features** is the area which will require the most communication and/or negotiation. Every feature is subjective and open for debate. If your feature involves user-facing design changes, please provide a mockup first so we can all get on the same page. As always, when in doubt, ask!
